# Parch Profiles

## What are profiles?

Profiles in the Parch distribution allow the user to install ready-to-use
software packages based on their needs.

The Available profiles are:

- Home User Profile

Users can choose a profile based on their needs.

For example the Home User Profile contains some tools and programs which will
become handy for home users. (e.g Development files won't installed)
